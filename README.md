# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
Why did you build this project?
- To create a functional web day planner 

What problem does it solve?
- It allows me and fellow workers to plan our day and save it if necessary

What did you learn?
- Originally I created many different getElementByid queries, then I changed route and instead used a system to get the id clicked and then got the element by that which required only one query.
- This was way easier with all the html and css done for me (that's what I typically spend half my time developing)
- I didn't really need or want jquery
- Moment is kind of cool
- For loops are pretty cool if you can use them correctly

Comments
- I was originally using the clear all button for testing purposes but it actually seemed pretty functional so I left it.
